# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a bank customer will exit (churn) using demographic, financial, and behavioral data. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including data cleaning, feature preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** (Accuracy: 0.811)  
- **Decision Tree** (Accuracy: 0.784)  

## Key Features
- Age, Balance, Credit Score, Estimated Salary, Number of Products  

## Techniques
- Missing value imputation  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Scaling numeric features  
- Pipelines for preprocessing  
- Train-test split  

## Insights
- Older customers and those with higher balances are more likely to churn  
- Active members are less likely to leave  

This notebook can be used as a reference for beginner-to-intermediate ML projects on customer churn prediction.
